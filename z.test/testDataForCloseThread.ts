Since you already know the words: yoru (night), hana (flower), sora (sky), machi (city), kirei (beautiful), hikari (light), and koe (voice), I’ll focus more on the new vocabulary and grammar as we go. Let’s break down the next lines: Romanji: Oto no nai futari dake no sekai de kikoeta kotoba wa "Suki da yo" Translation: "In a world with only the two of us and no sound, the words I heard were: 'I like you'" Breakdown: - oto (音) = sound - nai (無い) = none/no - futari (二人) = two people (together) - dake (だけ) = only - no (の) = connecting/possessive particle - sekai (世界) = world - de (で) = location marker (“in/at”) - kikoeta (聞こえた) = was heard/could be heard (past form of “kikoeru”) - kotoba (言葉) = words - wa (は) = topic marker - suki da yo (好きだよ) = “I like you” (direct, gentle confession) Combined Meaning: "In this silent world with just the two of us, what I heard was: 'I like you.'"

At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:03:17 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from user : i know futari, sekai, kotoba, suki da yo! :D yes continue At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:03:24 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from bot : Perfect—since you already know: yoru (night), hana (flower), sora (sky), machi (city), kirei (beautiful), hikari (light), koe (voice), futari (two people), sekai (world), kotoba (words), and suki da yo (“I like you!”), we’ll focus on the new grammar and less familiar vocabulary! Let’s continue with the next segment: Romanji: Yume no naka de mieta mirai no koto Natsu no yoru, kimi to, narabu kage ga futatsu Saigo no hanabi ga sora ni nobotte kietara Sore wo aizu ni Translation: “The future I saw in my dream A summer night, with you, two shadows side by side When the last firework climbs the sky and disappears That will be our signal” Breakdown highlights: - yume (夢) = dream - naka de (中で) = in (inside) - mieta (見えた) = could be seen/saw (past of mieru) - mirai (未来) = future - natsu (夏) = summer - kimi (君) = you - narabu (並ぶ) = to line up, stand side by side - kage (影) = shadow - futatsu (二つ) = two things (here: two shadows) - saigo (最後) = last - hanabi (花火) = firework - nobotte (昇って) = rising (te-form of noboru = to climb/rise) - kietara (消えたら) = if/when (it) disappears - sore (それ) = that - aizu (合図) = signal - ni (に) = as, for Combined meaning: “In a dream I saw the future: two shadows side by side on a summer night.

At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:04:57 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from user : no, quite a number of words that i alr know like yume, naka, mirai, natsu, saigo, futatsu, hanabi At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:05:09 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from bot : Great! You already know many words here—nice progress! Let’s highlight any new or tricky vocabulary/grammar and explain the rest of these lines. Romanji: Natsu no yoru, kimi to, narabu kage ga futatsu Saigo no hanabi ga sora ni nobotte kietara Sore wo aizu ni - natsu (夏) = summer (you know this!) - yoru (夜) = night (already known) - kimi (君) = you - narabu (並ぶ) = to line up, stand side by side - kage (影) = shadow, silhouette - futatsu (二つ) = two (you know this!) - saigo (最後) = last (already learned) - hanabi (花火) = firework (already learned) - sora ni (空に) = in the sky (combines “sky” + location particle) - nobotte (昇って) = rising, climbing (te-form of “noboru”: to rise/go up) - kietara (消えたら) = if/when it disappears (from “kieru”: to disappear + tara: if/when) - sore wo aizu ni (それを合図に) = using that (it) as a signal (“aizu”: signal) Combined meaning (all together): “A summer night—in the company of you, two shadows side by side. If/when the last firework rises into the sky and disappears, let that be our signal.” Let’s see if we can pick out a new grammar bit! What does the “tara” ending (as in “kietara”) do to a verb, like “kieru” (to disappear)? a) Describes a habitual action b) Means “if/when [verb happens]” c) Makes the verb negative What’s your answer? At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:05:42 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from user : b. can continue :D At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:05:56 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from bot : Correct! “-tara” (as in “kietara”) adds the meaning “if/when [verb happens]”—so “kietara” means “when it disappears” or “if it disappears”. Great job! Let’s continue with the next section: Romanji: Itsumo doori no asa ni Itsumo doori no kimi no sugata Omowazu me wo sorashite shimatta no wa Dou yattatte wasurerarenai kimi no kotoba Ima mo zutto hibiiteru kara Translation: “On a morning like always Seeing you as you always are I found myself looking away, without thinking Because I just can’t forget your words They’re still echoing within me even now” Breakdown: - itsumo doori (いつも通り) = as always, as usual - asa (朝) = morning - kimi (君) = you - sugata (姿) = appearance, figure - omowazu (思わず) = unintentionally, without thinking - me wo sorasu (目を逸らす) = to look away - shimatta (しまった) = ended up (adds regret/unintentional nuance) - dou yattatte (どうやったって) = no matter how I try - wasurerarenai (忘れられない) = can’t forget (negative potential form of wasureru: to forget) - ima mo (今も) = even now - zutto (ずっと) = all along, continuously - hibiiteru (響いてる) = echoing, resounding - kara (から) = because Combined meaning: “In a morning like any other, seeing you as always, I found myself looking away—because your words, which I can never forget, are still echoing in me even now.” Would you like to talk about any new word here, or see the next part? At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:07:26 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from user : i alr know itsumo, asa, kimi, ima yes continue please At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:07:36 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from bot : You’re making great progress! Let’s keep going with the next lines: Romanji: Yoru wo nukete yume no saki e Tadoritsukitai mirai e Hontou ni? Ano yume ni, hontou ni? Tte ima mo Fuan ni natte shimau kedo kitto Translation: “Escaping the night, toward what lies beyond the dream To the future I want to reach Really? In that dream, really?

At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:09:20 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from user : i know hontou ni, kedo, kitto too :D yes, quick quiz please At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:09:25 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from bot : Great! Here’s a quick quiz on the “–tai” form, which expresses “want to do” something in Japanese. In the line: Tadoritsukitai mirai e (辿り着きたい未来へ) “Tadoritsuku” (辿り着く) means “to reach (after effort).” The “–tai” form (着きたい) attaches to the verb stem to mean “want to reach.” QUIZ: Which of the following sentences correctly means “I want to eat”? a) Tabetai (食べたい) b) Tabemasu (食べます) c) Tabemashita (食べました) Write the letter (a, b, or c) and, if you like, try writing your own “I want to…” sentence with a verb you know! Let’s see your answer, and then we’ll keep moving! At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:09:46 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from user : a then continue At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:09:52 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from bot : Perfect! “a) Tabetai (食べたい)” means “I want to eat.” Great job! Short note: - “–tai” attaches to the verb stem: taberu → tabe + tai → tabetai (want to eat) - You can try this with other verbs: e.g., “ikitai” (行きたい) = “want to go”; “mitai” (見たい) = “want to see” Let’s continue the song: Romanji: Ima wo nukete asu no saki e Futari dake no basho e Mou chotto Douka kawaranaide Mou chotto Kimi kara no kotoba Ano mirai de matteiru yo Translation: “Leaving the present, to a place beyond tomorrow To a place for just the two of us A little more Please don’t change Just a bit longer The words from you Are waiting in that future” Breakdown: - ima (今) = now/present (you know this!) - wo nukete (を抜けて) = leaving/escaping from - asu no saki e (明日の先へ) = beyond tomorrow - futari dake (二人だけ) = just the two of us - no basho e (の場所へ) = to (our) place - mou chotto (もうちょっと) = a little more, just a bit longer - douka (どうか) = please (formal, polite wish) - kawaranaide (変わらないで) = don’t change (nai-de: “don’t [do]”) - kimi kara no kotoba (君からの言葉) = the words from you - ano mirai de (あの未来で) = in that future - matteiru yo (待っているよ) = are waiting Shall we practice with a quiz on the negative “–nai de” (don’t do), or move ahead? At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:11:20 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from user : i alr know dake, basho, mou, chotto, kotoba, mirai yes, practice please At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:11:25 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from bot : Awesome! Since you already know the words: dake (only/just), basho (place), mou (already), chotto (a little/bit), kotoba (words), and mirai (future), let’s quickly practice “–nai de”, which makes a negative request: “don’t do [something]”. Quick Quiz: If “kawaru” (変わる) means “to change”, what does “kawaranai de” (変わらないで) mean? a) Don’t go b) Don’t change c) Don’t wait Bonus: How would you say “Please don’t forget” in Japanese? (“Wasureru” = to forget) - a) Wasurenaide kudasai - b) Wasuremashita - c) Wasureru kudasai Type the letters for your answers! Then, we’ll move to the next part of the song. Ready? At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:12:27 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from user : a but what is the rule ? can you explain further At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:12:38 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from bot : Great questions! Let’s clarify the “–nai de” form in Japanese. Rule: “Verb in nai-form + de” (～ないで) = “Don’t [do] [verb]!” It tells someone NOT to do something, a negative request or command. How to make it: - Take the dictionary form of the verb (e.g., wasureru = to forget) - Change to “nai-form” (negative informal): wasureru → wasurenai (don’t forget) - Add “de”: wasurenai + de = wasurenai de (don’t forget) You can add “kudasai” (please) to be more polite: “wasurenai de kudasai” (please don’t forget). Examples: - “Kawaranai de” (変わらないで) = Don’t change - “Wasurenai de” (忘れないで) = Don’t forget Your quiz answers: 1. b) Don’t change (kawaranai de means “don’t change”) 2. a) Wasurenai de kudasai (means “please don’t forget”) Want to try making your own “don’t…” phrase with a verb you know, or move to the next lyrics? At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:13:44 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from user : why kawaru => kawaranaide, but wasureru => wasurenaide, not wasureranaide? At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:13:51 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from bot : Fantastic question! The difference comes from Japanese verb groups and how their “nai-form” (negative form) is created. 1. Group 1 (Godan verbs): With verbs like “kawaru” (変わる, to change), drop the -u and add -anai: - kawaru → kawar-anai So for "don’t change": - kawar-anai de (don’t change) 2. Group 2 (Ichidan verbs): With verbs like “wasureru” (忘れる, to forget), drop the -ru and add -nai: - wasureru → wasure-nai So for "don’t forget": - wasure-nai de (don’t forget) So: - kawaru → kawaranai de (Godan: -u → -anai de) - wasureru → wasurenai de (Ichidan: drop -ru, add -nai de) There's no “wasureranaide” because “wasureru” doesn’t use “-anaide”, it just takes “-nai de”. Would you like to practice forming more “don’t…” phrases with other verbs, or move to the next lyrics? At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:14:34 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from user : yes, let give me some common verbs so i can write them in this form At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:14:39 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from bot : Great! Here are five common Japanese verbs. Please try to put them into the “nai de” (don’t...) form! I’ll list their dictionary forms below: 1. Taberu (食べる) = to eat (Ichidan) 2. Iku (行く) = to go (Godan) 3. Miru (見る) = to see/watch (Ichidan) 4. Kuru (来る) = to come (Irregular) 5. Nomu (飲む) = to drink (Godan) Your task: Write the “nai de” form for each (e.g., “taber nai de” = don’t eat). Here’s a template to help: - Taberu → ________ - Iku → ________ - Miru → ________ - Kuru → ________ - Nomu → ________ Bonus: Add “kudasai” to any form to make it polite (e.g., “tabenai de kudasai” = please don’t eat). Give it a shot! I’ll check your answers and explain any tricky ones. Ready? At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:15:51 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from user : tabenaide, ikanaide, miranaide, kuranaide, nomanaide? At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:15:56 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from bot : Great job! Here are your answers — let’s check each one: 1. Taberu → tabenaide (食べないで) ✅ Correct! 2. Iku → ikanaide (行かないで) ✅ Correct! 3. Miru → miranaide (見ないで) ❌ Almost! For Ichidan verbs like miru (見る), just drop -ru and add -nai de: miru → minaide (見ないで) 4. Kuru → kuranaide (来ないで) ✅ Correct! 5. Nomu → nomanaide (飲まないで) ✅ Correct! Summary: - Ichidan (like taberu/miru): drop -ru, add -nai de → tabenaide, minaide - Godan (like iku/nomu): change -u to -a-nai de → ikanaide, nomanaide - Irregular: kuru → konai de Fixed: 3. Miru → minaide (見ないで) Fantastic effort! Want to practice a few more, or shall we dive back into the song lyrics? At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:16:31 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from user : how to know the verb is ichidan or godan? At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:16:39 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from bot : Excellent question! Knowing whether a verb is Ichidan or Godan is very helpful in Japanese, especially for making negations, “–tai” (want to), “–te” forms, etc. Here’s how you can usually tell: 1. Ichidan verbs (also called "ru-verbs" or Group 2): - Their dictionary form ends with -iru or -eru (e.g., taberu, miru). - To change form (like nai, tai, te), you simply drop the -ru and add the ending. - Example: taberu → tabeNAI, tabeTE, tabeTAI 2. Godan verbs (also called "u-verbs" or Group 1): - End with a variety of -u sounds, NOT always -iru or -eru (ikiru, hashiru are exceptions!). - To change the ending, the last syllable changes according to a pattern. - Example: nomu → nomaNAI, nonDE, nomITAI - Some verbs ending in -eru or -iru are still Godan (e.g., hashiru [to run], shiru [to know]), but most are Ichidan. Quick tip for beginners: - Most verbs ending in -eru/-iru = Ichidan (unless on this exception list: hashiru, shiru, hairu, kiru [to cut], etc.). - Other endings = Godan. Would you like a mini quiz? Or see a list of common exceptions? Or move on with the song?

At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:21:28 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from user : just jump to quiz :D At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:21:33 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from bot : Let’s jump straight into the quiz! Here are a few questions based on the last segment of the lyrics: 1. Vocabulary: What does “tadoritsuita” (辿り着いた) mean? a) To decorate b) Reached/arrived (after effort) c) Covered 2. Grammar: Which expression means "It’s okay" or "Don’t worry"? a) Daijoubu (大丈夫) b) Oto no nai (音の無い) c) Kasanarau (重なり合う) 3. Open question: How would you say “Don’t end!” in Japanese using the “nai de” form and the verb “owaru” (to end)? 4. Extra: The phrase “suki da yo” (好きだよ) is often used at the end of songs or confessions. What feeling does it express? Reply with your answers (numbered is fine)! If you want any hints or a breakdown, just let me know! At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:22:28 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from user : 1c, 2a, 3 owanaide, 4 love confession :D At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:22:33 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from bot : Nice try! Let’s check your answers and clarify a couple of points: 1. “tadoritsuita” (辿り着いた) You chose c) Covered, but the answer was b) Reached/arrived (after effort). “Tadoritsuku” is used for finally arriving at a place or state after some effort or journey. 2. “Daijoubu” (大丈夫) You picked a) — Correct! This means “It’s okay” or “Don’t worry.” 3. “Don’t end!” with “nai de” form of “owaru”: Your answer, “owanaide,” is close! The negative form of “owaru” is “owaranai,” so: - owaranai de (終わらないで) = Don’t end! 4. “Suki da yo” (好きだよ) You said “love confession :D” — absolutely right! It’s an affectionate confession, often “I like you” or “I love you” in context. Great effort! Would you like to review anything from this song, try a listening exercise, or pick another song to learn? At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:23:44 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from user : i still want to practice with quiz At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:23:49 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from bot : Great! Let’s keep practicing with some quizzes based on what we’ve covered so far. Here we go: 1. Vocabulary: What does “kasanaRIAU” (重なり合う) mean? a) To shine b) To overlap/come together c) To wait 2. Grammar: Choose the correct “nai de” form of the verb “miru” (to see/watch): a) miru naide b) miranaide c) minaide 3. Sentence meaning: Translate this phrase: “Oto no nai sekai ni hibiita ‘Suki da yo’” a) “In a noisy world, I ran away, ‘I like you.’” b) “In a silent world, ‘I like you’ echoed.” c) “In a bright world, ‘I like you’ smiled.” 4. Open Question: What is the meaning of the phrase “futari dake no yoru”? Make a short English translation! Give your answers with numbers (e.g., 1b, 2a…). Want more explanation on any question? Let me know! At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:25:31 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from user : 1a, 2c, 3b, 4: the night with only 2 of us! can you explain more on the word hibiita, what is the original form of this verb and why it is in this form? At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:25:40 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from bot : Well done on your quiz! Here’s feedback and your requested explanation: 1. “kasanaRIAU” (重なり合う): Correct answer is b) To overlap/come together. (You put a)—so keep in mind “kasanaRIAU” is all about merging or coming together, not shining! 2. “nai de” form of “miru”: You answered c) minaide, which is correct! 3. “Oto no nai sekai ni hibiita ‘Suki da yo’”: You said b), which is right! “In a silent world, ‘I like you’ echoed.” 4. “futari dake no yoru”: Your answer, “the night with only 2 of us!” is perfect! About “hibiita” (響いた): - Original/dictionary form: hibi-ku (響く), meaning “to echo,” “to resound.” - “hibiita” is the past plain form (“ta-form”): hibi-ku → hibi-ita (響いた) = “echoed” or “resounded.” Why “hibiita”? Japanese verbs end in “-ta” to make simple past tense. - Example: taberu → tabeta (ate), hiku → hiita (pulled), hibiku → hibiita (echoed). So “hibiita” = “(it) echoed/resounded” (in this context, "Suki da yo" echoed). Would you like one more grammar quiz or listening/comprehension challenge? At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:27:02 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from user : can you explain more on how to use the "-ta" form. i only know mashita form At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:27:09 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from bot : Great question! You already know the “-mashita” form (polite past), like “tabemashita” = “ate.” The "-ta" form is the plain/casual past tense in Japanese. It’s super important, as it’s used in daily conversation, many songs, stories, or when talking with friends/family. Here’s how it works: 1. Ichidan verbs (e.g., taberu, miru): Drop -ru, add -ta taberu → tabeta (ate) miru → mita (saw) 2. Godan verbs (e.g., kaku, nomu): The final syllable changes: - kaku (write) → kaita (wrote) - nomu (drink) → nonda (drank) - kau (buy) → katta (bought) Godan “rules” change depending on the verb ending. 3. Irregular: - kuru → kita (came) - suru → shita (did) 4. Usage: - Talking about past actions or events casually Ex: Kinou pan wo tabeta. (“I ate bread yesterday.”) Difference: - “Mashita” is polite. - “Ta” form is casual/plain. Ex: - Tabemashita = I ate (polite). - Tabeta = I ate (casual/plain). Want to try converting a few verbs into their -ta form? Shall I quiz you, or explain godan changes in more detail? At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:28:34 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from user : can you explain more on godan rules based on the verb ending At Thu Jun 12 2025 23:28:46 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) from bot : Absolutely! Here’s a simple guide on how Godan (u-verbs) change to the -ta form based on their endings. Godan verbs require a few different patterns, depending on the final sound of the verb’s plain form: 1. Verbs ending with -u, -tsu, -ru: - Change ending to -tta. Examples: kau (買う, buy) → katta (買った) matsu (待つ, wait) → matta (待った) toru (取る, take) → totta (取った) 2. Ending with -mu, -bu, -nu: - Change to -nda. Examples: yomu (読む, read) → yonda (読んだ) asobu (遊ぶ, play) → asonda (遊んだ) shinu (死ぬ, die) → shinda (死んだ) 3. Ending with -ku: - Change to -ita. Example: kaku (書く, write) → kaita (書いた) BUT: -gu becomes -ida oyogu (泳ぐ, swim) → oyoida (泳いだ) 4. Ending with -su: - Change to -shita. Example: hanasu (話す, speak) → hanashita (話した) Quick review: - -u, -tsu, -ru → -tta - -mu, -bu, -nu → -nda - -ku → -ita - -gu → -ida - -su → -shita Would you like a quiz to practice this, or specific verbs to try yourself?

Here’s the check: 1a) 見る (miru) → みた (mita) ✔️ 2b) 「好きだよ」(suki da yo) means “I like you.” ✔️ 3a) 読む (yomu, “to read”) follows –mu → –nda → 読んだ (yonda) ✔️ 4) “夜の空を飾る綺麗な花” (yoru no sora wo kazaru kirei na hana): Your translation, “a pretty flower decorate the night sky,” is almost perfect! Tiny tweak: “A beautiful flower decorating the night sky.” - 綺麗 (kirei) = beautiful - 夜の空 (yoru no sora) = night sky - 飾る (kazaru) = decorating You’re spot-on.
